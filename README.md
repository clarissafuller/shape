## ShapeUp is your ultimate workout tracking system, optimized to help you plan your weekly routines at the gym

Our motivation for creating ShapeUp was to help our user track their workout routine, choose new workouts, and plan their week accordingly. Through creating new Routines with attached exercises, a user can track their gym progress easily in one place.
We learned the exponential complexity of working with this type of data and appreciate the effort that goes into similar applications.
We plan to further develop more features in the future to plan the month of work outs, view details of every exercise, and edit exercises to tailor to your needs and equipment.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you will simply follow the link to visit our deployed page. Once there, you will need to create a username, enter your email, and create a password. Once logged in, you can start creating your own workouts from the URL here:
[Shape Up](https://shape-up-4300c0d6cf80.herokuapp.com/login)

## Usage/Tests

Navigating our interface is simple, in order to create a new routine, click the "create a new workout" button, or click the same link in the navigation bar.
Once on the Routine page, search for a workout, add your desired workout with your desired weight( in lbs), number of Sets, and number of Reps. When you click the "add to routine" button, your new routine will display on the left of the page, and allow you to edit the name of the Routine and the day of the week you would like to schedule it for.
The process should look something like this:
